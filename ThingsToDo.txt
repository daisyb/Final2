Stuff we have to do going forward:

1)Create a board/Figure out how to randomly generate new  boards
	 - both a graphic board that appears on screen, and a stored version of the board for our code
2)Create a system of movement throughout the board (up, down, left, right)
	 - should recognize where the piece is in relation to the walls.
3)Make it so the player can use the keyboard to access the movement functions
4)Modify a maze solving algorithm to fit our project
5)Use the algorithm to have the computer piece move on it's own at varying speeds
6)Mess around with settings to create different difficulties.
	- easy, medium, hard, satan (slow --> real time)
7)Aim for 3 different levels, different size for each
8)Scoring based on how far away opponent is. 5 point for every block away from goal it is



Anything to add?



//What I learned this period
Idk if you'll see this next period or like tomorrow when it totally isn't useful
but this is what I figured out today (it ain't much):
to use processing at school type:
   cd /usr/local/processing	-->
   ./processing			-->
 
really simple tutorial:

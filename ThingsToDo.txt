Stuff we have to do going forward:

1)Create a board/Figure out how to randomly generate new  boards
	 - both a graphic board that appears on screen, and a stored version of the board for our code
2)Create a system of movement throughout the board (up, down, left, right)
	 - should recognize where the piece is in relation to the walls.
3)Make it so the player can use the keyboard to access the movement functions
4)Modify a maze solving algorithm to fit our project
5)Use the algorithm to have the computer piece move on it's own at varying speeds
6)Mess around with settings to create different difficulties.

7?? Should we have multiple levels? Like each level it gets a little harder (in terms of speed, complexity, etc.)
8?? System of scoring? Maybe based on how long it took you to solve the puzzle or how many moves or how close the computer piece was to solving it???


Anything to add?
